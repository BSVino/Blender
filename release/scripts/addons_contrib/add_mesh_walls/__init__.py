"""
    This script builds a wall; at current 3D-Cursor location.
    The wall can be modified to be a disc (radial), curved (slope), or dome (radial+slope).
    Actually, it could be a path, or a tower, or anything made with blocks.
    Crenelations also work which can double as arrow slits or support beam holes.
    Slots, both vertical and horizontal, can be added as openings.
    Steps and platforms may be added as extensions to the wall.
